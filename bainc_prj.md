Project title: Thinking with Turtles in the Wolfram Language
Project description: For many years, Logo and its programmable turtle have served as an entry point to computation for programmers around the world. While modern languages like the Wolfram Language have developed into true "knowledge machines", current turtle-based languages like NetLogo are still quite powerful when a problem can be described using agent-based thinking. In this project, we'll explore what agent-based thinking looks like in the Wolfram language. Specifically, we'll be making extensive use of Dynamic and Manipulate (both of which greatly resemble graphical features of NetLogo) and expanding past the basic turtle-graphics that AnglePath provides.
